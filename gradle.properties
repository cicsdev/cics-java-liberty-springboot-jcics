# Values in this file provide defaults to variables used in the

# Normally we don't publish any built artifacts to a repository.
# But if we do, these are the default values we use to indicate
# where the files should be placed.
#
# These can be over-ridden from the command line 
# with -Ppublish_repo_releases_url="file://my-folder" for example.
# 
# These values only have any effect if the publish goal is used.
# For example: gradle build publish.
