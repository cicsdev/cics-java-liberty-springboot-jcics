# cics-java-liberty-springboot-jcics


This sample provides a Spring Boot application that uses the JCICS TSQ Java API to provide a RESTful CICS temporary storage queue (TSQ) browsing service. The sample also provides a set of Maven and Gradle build files 
for use either in Eclipse or standalone build environments.

For further details about the development of this sample refer to the tutorial [Spring Boot Java applications for CICS, Part 1: JCICS, Gradle, and Maven](https://developer.ibm.com/tutorials/spring-boot-java-applications-for-cics-part-1-jcics-maven-gradle/)


## Requirements

- CICS TS V5.3 or later
- A configured Liberty JVM server in CICS
- Java SE 1.8 on the z/OS system
- Java SE 1.8 on the workstation
- An Eclipse development environment on the workstation (optional)
- Either Gradle or Apache Maven on the workstation (optional if using Wrappers)



## Downloading

- Clone the repository using your IDEs support, such as the Eclipse Git plugin
- **or**, download the sample as a [ZIP](https://github.com/cicsdev/cics-java-liberty-springboot-jcics/archive/main.zip) and unzip onto the workstation

>*Tip: Eclipse Git provides an 'Import existing Projects' check-box when cloning a repository.*


### Check dependencies
 
Before building this sample, you should verify that the correct CICS TS bill of materials (BOM) is specified for your target release of CICS. The BOM specifies a consistent set of artifacts, and adds information about their scope. In the example below the version specified is compatible with CICS TS V5.5 with JCICS APAR PH25409, or newer. That is, the Java byte codes built by compiling against this version of JCICS will be compatible with later CICS TS versions and subsequent JCICS APARs. 
You can browse the published versions of the CICS BOM at [Maven Central.](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.ibm.cics/com.ibm.cics.ts.bom)
 
Gradle (build.gradle): 

`compileOnly enforcedPlatform("com.ibm.cics:com.ibm.cics.ts.bom:5.5-20200519131930-PH25409")`

Maven (POM.xml):

``` xml	
<dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
      <dependency>
        <groupId>com.ibm.cics</groupId>
        <artifactId>com.ibm.cics.ts.bom</artifactId>
        <version>5.5-20200519131930-PH25409</version>
        <type>pom</type>
        <scope>import</scope>
      </dependency>
    </dependencies>
  </dependencyManagement>
  ```

  
## Building 

You can build the sample using an IDE of your choice, or you can build it from the command line. For both approaches, using the supplied Gradle or Maven wrapper is the recommended way to get a consistent version of build tooling. 

On the command line, you simply swap the Gradle or Maven command for the wrapper equivalent, `gradlew` or `mvnw` respectively.
  
For an IDE, taking Eclipse as an example, the plug-ins for Gradle *buildship* and Maven *m2e* will integrate with the "Run As..." capability, allowing you to specify whether you want to build the project with a Wrapper, or a specific version of your chosen build tool.

The required build-tasks are typically `clean bootWar` for Gradle and `clean package` for Maven. Once run, Gradle will generate a WAR file in the `build/libs` directory, while Maven will generate it in the `target` directory.

**Note:** When building a WAR file for deployment to Liberty it is good practice to exclude Tomcat from the final runtime artifact. We demonstrate this in the pom.xml with the *provided* scope, and in build.gradle with the *providedRuntime()* dependency.

**Note:** If you import the project to your IDE, you might experience local project compile errors. To resolve these errors you should run a tooling refresh on that project. For example, in Eclipse: right-click on "Project", select "Gradle -> Refresh Gradle Project", **or** right-click on "Project", select "Maven -> Update Project...".

>Tip: *In Eclipse, Gradle (buildship) is able to fully refresh and resolve the local classpath even if the project was previously updated by Maven. However, Maven (m2e) does not currently reciprocate that capability. If you previously refreshed the project with Gradle, you'll need to manually remove the 'Project Dependencies' entry on the Java build-path of your Project Properties to avoid duplication errors when performing a Maven Project Update.*  

#### Gradle Wrapper (command line)

Run the following in a local command prompt:

On Linux or Mac:

```shell
./gradlew clean bootWar
```
On Windows:

```shell
gradlew.bat clean bootWar
```

This creates a WAR file inside the `build/libs` directory.

#### Maven Wrapper (command line)


Run the following in a local command prompt:

On Linux or Mac:

```shell
./mvnw clean package
```

On Windows:

```shell
mvnw.cmd clean package
```

This creates a WAR file inside the `target` directory.



## Deploying to a CICS Liberty JVM server

- Ensure you have the following features defined in your Liberty `server.xml`:           
    - `<servlet-3.1>` or `<servlet-4.0>` depending on the version of Java EE in use.  
    - `<cicsts:security-1.0>` if CICS security is enabled.
    	 
>**Note:** `servlet-4.0` will only work for CICS TS V5.5 or later
    
- Deployment option 1:
    - Copy and paste the built WAR from your *target* or *build/libs* directory into a Eclipse CICS bundle project and create a new WAR bundlepart that references the WAR file. Then deploy the CICS bundle project from CICS Explorer using the **Export Bundle Project to z/OS UNIX File System** wizard.
    
   
- Deployment option 2:
    - Manually upload the WAR file to zFS and add an `<application>` element to the Liberty server.xml to define the web application with access to all authenticated users. For example the following application element can be used to install a WAR, and grant access to all authenticated users if security is enabled.
 
``` XML
<application id="cics-java-liberty-springboot-jcics-0.1.0"  
    location="${server.config.dir}/springapps/cics-java-liberty-springboot-jcics-0.1.0.war"  
    name="cics-java-liberty-springboot-jcics-0.1.0" type="war">
    <application-bnd>
        <security-role name="cicsAllAuthenticated">
        <special-subject type="ALL_AUTHENTICATED_USERS"/>
    </security-role>
   </application-bnd>  
</application>
```


## Trying out the sample

The example application is divided into four services which perform actions on a CICS temporary storage queuue (TSQ). Each with their own REST service suffix as follows:

- *info* - query information about the TSQ
- *write* - write information to a TSQ 
- *browse* - read items from the TSQ
- *delete* - delete the TSQ

 
 
1. Ensure the web application started successfully in Liberty by checking for msg `CWWKT0016I` in the Liberty messages.log:
    - `A CWWKT0016I: Web application available (default_host): http://myzos.mycompany.com:httpPort/cics-java-liberty-springboot-jcics-0.1.0`
    - `I SRVE0292I: Servlet Message - [com.ibm.cicsdev.springboot.jcics-0.1.0]:.Initializing Spring embedded WebApplicationContext`
  
2. Copy the context root from message CWWKT0016I along with the REST service suffix into you web browser. For example to write the string `ILOVECICS` to a TSQ called SPGJCICS:
    - `http://myzos.mycompany.com:httpPort/cics-java-liberty-springboot-jcics-0.1.0/write?tsq=SPGJCICS&item=ILOVECICS` 
  
3. Check if the specified TSQ has the information you expected by either: 
    - Executing the CICS command `CEBR SPGJCICS` on a 3270 terminal. For this example, you should see `ILOVECICS` in TSQ SPGJCICS, or
    - Using the browse TSQ service URL for example to check the content of TSQ SPGJCICS
        - `http://myzos.mycompany.com:httpPort/cics-java-liberty-springboot-jcics-0.1.0/browse?tsq=SPGJCICS` 
  
4. If you use the TSQ info service you will see the basic information for TSQ SPGJCICS
    - `http://myzos.mycompany.com:httpPort/cics-java-liberty-springboot-jcics-0.1.0/info?tsq=SPGJCICS`   

5. If you want to delete this TSQ, you can use the delete service for example
    - `http://myzos.mycompany.com:httpPort/cics-java-liberty-springboot-jcics-0.1.0/delete?tsq=SPGJCICS`
